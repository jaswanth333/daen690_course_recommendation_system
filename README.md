This repistory contains the files and reports for Course Recommendation System created as part of DAEN 690 Capstone project
#Problem statement
In today's fast-paced and competitive world, there is a need for an efficient and personalized course recommendation system that can help individuals and organizations keep pace with their learning and development goals. However, traditional course recommendation systems often struggle to accurately predict the courses that would be of interest to an individual or group, leading to a poor user experience and decreased satisfaction. The problem is to design a course recommendation system that can effectively learn the preferences and learning patterns of users and provide highly relevant and personalized course recommendations, thus improving their overall learning and development experience.
#Objective
The goal of the project is to develop an artificial intelligence-based tool to recommend courses to prospects or existing students.
